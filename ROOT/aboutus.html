<p>Pratham is an innovative learning organization created to improve the quality of education in India. As one of the largest non-     governmental   organizations in the country, Pratham focuses on high-quality, low-cost, and replicable interventions to address gaps in the education system. Established in 1995 to provide education to children in the slums of Mumbai, Pratham has grown both in scope and geographical coverage.

Pratham means 'first' in Sanskrit. True to its name, it is the first major organization to achieve lasting, wide-scale success in India's educational landscape. This has been made possible due to various policies and strategies adopted by the organization. </p>
